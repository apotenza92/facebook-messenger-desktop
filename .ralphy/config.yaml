rules:

  - "Follow existing code patterns in src/main/ and src/preload/"
  - "Use async/await for promises"
  - "Console logging format: [Component] message"
  - "ONLY beta versions (e.g., 1.2.3-beta.1) may be released without user permission. NEVER run release.sh for stable versions (e.g., 1.2.3) - always stop and ask user first."

  - "macOS: close hides to dock; Windows/Linux: close minimizes to tray"
