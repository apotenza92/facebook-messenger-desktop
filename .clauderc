# Claude Code Configuration for this Repository

## Critical Rules

### 🚫 NEVER Create Release Tags Without Permission

**Before running any command that creates or pushes git tags (v*):**
1. Ask the user explicitly: "Should I create and push the release tag vX.Y.Z now?"
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Only proceed after getting explicit "yes" or "go ahead"

**Commands that require permission:**
- `git tag v*`
- `git push origin v*`
- `gh release create`
- Any command that would trigger the release workflow

### ✅ Safe Development Workflow

You CAN do these without asking:
- Commit code changes
- Push to main branch (without tags)
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Update package.json version
- Run builds and tests
- Create non-version tags (that don't start with 'v')

### Emergency Tag Deletion

If you accidentally created a tag:
1. Immediately inform the user
2. Delete it with: `git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`
3. Delete the GitHub release if created: `gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes`

## Release Process Summary

1. **Development Phase** (no permission needed):
   - Make code changes
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update package.json version
   - Commit and push to main

2. **Pause Point** - STOP AND ASK:
   - "The code is ready for release vX.Y.Z. Should I create and push the release tag now?"

3. **Release Phase** (only after explicit permission):
   - Create tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
   - Push tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
   - This triggers GitHub Actions to build and release
